OVERVIEW

Kudos to Eric Wright for his work! This is an adaptation for my needs, free for the world to use.


The template will create a new Rails app and then: 
- add authlogic and create working User and UserSession models, controllers, and views
- install haml and sass using Compass/gs960
- install sass_on_heroku plugin so you're ready for heroku deployment
- adds a .gems file for heroku to digest on deployment. A couple extra gems are there that I like to have available: RedCloth 4.1.9 and cancan.
- remove junk like public/index.html
- add jquery
- add reset.css
- create a new git repo and add everything to it except the stuff you never want in your git repo.

This does not install the heroku gem. It assumes you have heroku setup already. 

CAVEATS

The same as Eric's: This Rails template assumes you'll be creating the new rails project next to this template directory.  A bad assumption, I know -- I'll fix it as soon as I know how to reference the location of the template as a variable (the way you can get the rails path with @root).  

INSTALLING

Put this template dir in the same location you want the new rails app.  If it started as an empty dir, template/ will be the only thing in there, like this:

$ ls
template

Run the rails command and pass in the main template:

$ rails foo -m ./master_template/main.template.rb

This will prompt once for your password (when you run sudo rake gems:install), then for default folders for your sass_dir and css_dir.
